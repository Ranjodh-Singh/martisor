                            =Design Document=

The basic functionality will include the features related to quiz module which itself would be having two features :
 
  * The  Tutorial : This part will take user through some interesting topics .The tutorial shall create the ground for the quiz part of the application.

_write your ideas here_

UI part of *The Tutorial* shall be described in different page.

  * The  Quiz : This part will take user through the series of questions and will track the record number of times he attempted and correctly answered the questions in given time.

  * user will be provided with certain topics.when user selects one of the topic , he will be taken to the quiz module .
  *quiz module* : Initially user will get 100 health point to take help through a particular quiz.

each question will be on N marks and if user provides wrong answer (if number of attempts are 0<= n < 3 ) .Effective marks given for particular question will be N/(n+1) . 
 
there will be a help like of button with each question , if user is uncertain about the correct answer he can get help to solve the problem but 20 the health points will be subtracted from current health .

so considering above scenario there are two Life Lines for the user 
   # Health points(HP) : wouldn't affect the effective marks for particular              question.
   # number of attempts(n-factor) : would deduct marks from an question. 

UI part of *The Quiz* shall be described in different page.
